# CUDA
This repository is an introduction to Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++.

I will address 3 main topics:

  Accelerating Applications with CUDA C/C++.
  Managing Accelerated Application Memory with CUDA C/C++ Unified Memory and nsys.
  Asynchronous Streaming, and Visual Profiling for Accelerated Applications with CUDA C/C++.
